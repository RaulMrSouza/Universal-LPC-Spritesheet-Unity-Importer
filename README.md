# Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Unity-Importer
Slice and rename sprites from a generated LPC Character Spritesheet automatically in Unity.

# Setup
Simply clone this repository into your project. Whenever you import a Spritesheet it automatically checks if it is a LPC based Spritesheet [(1)](https://github.com/makrohn/Universal-LPC-spritesheet)[(2)](https://github.com/Gaurav0/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator), slices the image, and gives those sprites new names based on this official convention:  
* sc: spellcast
* th: thrust
* wc: walkcycle
* sl: slash
* sh: shoot
* hu: hurt

# Usage
Pictures say more than words
